1. Introduction
   ------------
The psys library provides a simple interface to the system package manager
of a Linux system. It allows installation programs to notify the package
manager of the installation, uninstallation and update of third-party
software packages, and to request these packages to be added to or removed
from the system package database. The psys library interface is generic
and not tied to a specific package management system or Linux distribution.

Note that the psys library is only useful for adding and removing software
which complies to the Linux Standard Base (LSB) specifications [1]. Most
notably, it is assumed that the data files of a software package are
installed into /opt as demanded by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
[2], and that a package only depends on the interfaces and behavior
specified by the LSB; any additional dependencies must be contained within
the package itself.

The psys library interface is meant as a proposal for a future version of
the LSB standard.

2. Design
   ------
The psys library implementation is divided into two parts. The first part,
the "frontend", implements the distribution-independent functions of the
psys library, e.g. for the creation of the psys data structures. This part
is fully implemented by the psys library sourcecode itself. The second part,
the "backend", is specific to a package manager or Linux distribution and
implements the actual core functionality of the psys library interface. It
can either be implemented by the package manager / distribution directly
(see HACKING) or, if it isn't, by a "fallback backend" built into the psys
library itself. Currently, the psys library comes with a fallback backend
for RPM-based distributions; others may be added in the future. See HACKING
for general information about writing a psys library backend.

The availability of fallback backends means that the psys library can, in
principal, be used on today's distros by installation programs which ship
the library theirselves or statically link to it. As the psys library only
takes care of the commmunication with the package manager, but leaves the
actual installation / update / uninstallation to the installation program,
adopting an existing installer to use the psys interface should require
relatively little modifications to the installer's code. 

3. Installation
   ------------
The psys library can be built as any autotools-powered project with

    ./configure
    make
    make install

(the last command as root or sudo.) To build with the fallback backend,
configure with --enable-fallbacks:

    ./configure --enable-fallback
    make
    make install

Note that you need rpmlib installed for this.

4. Documentation
   -------------
The psys library interface is documented in man page format; see the
psys(7) man page distributed with this library to get started.
Alternatively, all pages are available online at:

http://gitorious.org/libpsys/pages/Home

5. Contributing
   ------------
Contributions of any kind are, of course, very welcome! Please submit
bug reports, patches, feature requests and branch merge requests to
the mailing list:

To track the development of the psys library and get the latest source
code, visit the project page on Gitorious:

You are free to publish any number psys library branches there if you like.

For some information about hacking on the psys library sourcecode, and a
short overview of writing psys library backends, see HACKING.
